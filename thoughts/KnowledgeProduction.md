# Blockchaining Wikipedia, Everpedia, & thoughts about knowledge commons in 2018...

[So there is much talk about the next online encyclopedia](https://qz.com/1151073/wikipedias-cofounder-on-how-hes-creating-a-bigger-better-rival-on-the-blockchain/)...  
Well kinda, some of the [talk](https://www.wired.com/story/everipedia-blockchain/) seems mostly in the tech bubble-sphere... but it is a moment worth refelecting on.

The blockchain aspires towards this notion that information is best when produced by everyone and that in avoiding editing supervisors people can flock to their niche community of choice to produce content. While I agree with the idea that ideas and knowledge are better with everyone's input, I think this type of work requires social structures of editing, decision making, and consensus making, and holding space for dissent which go beyond techological infrastructure

this structure lacks the art of an idea which has a gesture and concise beauty of structure and it just provides a means for generating wondrous and terrifuing noise data.

Or perhaps this is all just part of the skynet AI takeover event horizon where Facebook, Google, and this blockchained out knowledge hive rule the world.
